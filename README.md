# DiscordPyBot

### Tech

DiscordPyBot uses a number of Python libraries to work properly:

* [PRAW](https://pypi.org/project/praw/)
* [Wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/)
* [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

### Configuration

 The only file that needs configuration right now is the "credentials.py"
 Edit the "example_crediantials.py" with your own credentials, and rename the file to "credentials.py"

### Running the Bot

Run in the source directory using:
```sh
py ./main.py
```
Or using your own preferred method. Just run main.py
