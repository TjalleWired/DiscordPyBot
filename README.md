# DiscordPyBot
 My personal Discord Bot Project. Nothing serious nor professional.

 Configuration:
 The only file that needs configuration right now is the credentials.py
 Edit the example_crediantials.py with your own credentials, and rename the file to "credentials.py"

 Running: 
 Run in Python 3.6.0 or up 

 Run using py ./main.py with CMD opened in your source folder. (or use your own preferred method, just run main.py)
